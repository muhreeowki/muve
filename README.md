Muve simplifies the process of converting playlists between YouTube and Spotify. Here's how to use it:

1. 📝 **Create an Account**: Sign up for a Muve account to get started.

2. 🔗 **Connect Your Accounts**: Link your Spotify and YouTube accounts to Muve. This allows us to access your playlists and create new ones.

3. 🎵 **Select Source Platform**: Choose either YouTube or Spotify as your source platform.

4. 📋 **Choose a Playlist**: Muve will display all your playlists from the selected platform. Pick the one you want to convert.

5. ✅ **Select Songs**: Decide whether you want to convert all songs or just a few selected tracks from the playlist.

6. 🎧 **Choose Destination Platform**: Select the platform you want to convert your playlist to (YouTube or Spotify).

7. 🔄 **Convert**: Click the "Convert" button and let Muve work its magic!

8. ✨ **Access Your New Playlist**: Once the conversion is complete, Muve will provide a link to your newly created playlist on the destination platform.

🎉 With Muve, transferring your favorite playlists between platforms is just a few clicks away. Enjoy your music, your way!

🔐 **Note**: You'll need to log in to both your YouTube and Spotify accounts to authorize Muve to access and create playlists on your behalf.

⚠️ **TroubleShooting**: If a song isn't found on the destination platform, Muve will skip it and continue with the rest of the playlist. Check the conversion summary for any skipped tracks.
